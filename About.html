            <h2>★About the Creator★</h2>
            <p> “Hello, The Name i go by is Peter Peter Pumpkin eater, peter griffin, Justin Berber, nonchalant deadhead, but really my name is Kekele, but most people i know call me KK. As of now im going into the 11th grade, The reason for creating this site is for new/up and coming artist to experiment with their flow and try and find their rhythm. I've been creating music since I was in the fifth grade and I want more people to have a chance of being as interested in music as I am, and more importantly to see more sides of music than before, music practically runs through my family and my veins so i belive its important to introduce more people to music like me."</p>
